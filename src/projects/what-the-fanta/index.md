_What the Fanta_ was a marketing campaign for [The Coca-Cola Company](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/) to reveal a new mystery flavor of Fanta soda. The project involved the development of a sweepstakes website and a small game. Using clues hidden on the web page, and additional ones earned by playing the game, visitors would submit flavor guesses to the sweepstakes.
