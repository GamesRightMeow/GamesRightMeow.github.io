_What the Fanta_ was a marketing campaign for [The Coca-Cola Company](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/) to reveal a new mystery flavor of Fanta soda. The project involved the development of a sweepstakes website and a small game. Using clues hidden on the web page, and additional ones earned by playing the game, visitors would submit flavor guesses to the sweepstakes.

# My responsibilities
I responsible for developing an obstacle avoidance game for the campaign in collaboration with [IfThen](https://www.ifthen.com/). My focus was on engineering and game design.

# Key contributions
* Crafted a procedurally generated level system that was stitched together from smaller, hand crafted chunks.
* Optimized the game to run across a variety of mobile devices and desktop browsers.
* Tuned the difficulty to create a challenging, yet accessible experience.
