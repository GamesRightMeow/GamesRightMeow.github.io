## Acquire an Item

**When you obtain an important item, tool, or piece of equipment**, envision the durability and quality of the item. Then assign it an appropriate clock depending if the item is...

* fragile or poorly made: 4 segments
* of ordinary quality: 6 segments
* rugged or reinforced: 8 segments
* masterfully well-built: 10 segments

When making a move with the item and score a weak hit or a miss, and you must suffer resources, you may progress the clock instead.

If the clock is full, the item is unusable until repaired. Envision how the item is damaged or malfunctioning.

When you <u>Repair</u> the item, clear the clock.
