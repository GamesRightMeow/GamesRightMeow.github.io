This website has existed in some shape or form since 2018. I had intended it to be the home of an indie video game studio, but I never actually got around to forming the company. Since it's meow 2022 and I can't bare part with the domain, I've decided to re-launch as a gaming blog ðŸš€

However I'm currently on hiatus from video games, both as a player and a developer, so I'll be focusing on TTRPGs for awhile. Particularly solo ones, and probably a lot of [Starforged](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged). 

But don't fret! I already have a list of content I want to write; I just need to start writing it ðŸ˜… It's been about 10 years since I've kept up a proper blog, so I'm looking forward to getting back into it.
