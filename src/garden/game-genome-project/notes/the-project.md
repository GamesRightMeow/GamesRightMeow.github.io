The Game Genome Project (a riff off of [Pandora's "Music Genome Project"](https://www.pandora.com/about/mgp)) was born out of my frustration with trying to find games I like.

Genres do a decent job of providing a broad idea of what a game is, but there's so much variation within even the same genre that its not helpful when I'm looking for something _specific_.

Realistically, this isn't going to solve my problem as no one is likely ever to adapt this method of cataloging games, but I thought it might be a fun thought experiment for analyzing games I play, and trying to identify common genes.

## What is a video game "gene"?

I'm no scientist, so I have no idea what a gene _really_ is, but I'm fairly confident that I can say genes define traits. In human's for example that's hair color, height, natural talent, tendency to start too many projects, etc.

Games too have traits e.g. grid based movement, first person perspective, procedurally generated content, etc. Identifying and defining these traits is the goal of this project!

Though now in retrospect these probably should be called "traits" not genes, but alas, the _Game Trait Project_ doesn't quite sound as _good_. Games often simplify complex real-world concepts into (often laughably) simple mechanics, so I don't feel that bad about this.

I'm going to specifically avoid thematic genes (i.e. ones that describe the subject matter of a game like space, fantasy, cats, dwarfs, etc) and focus on genes that define mechanics and systems. Mainly because mechanics (i.e. what you _do_ in a game) is usually what I'm most interested in, but also because I don't want to define thousands of genes for all the different types of themes out there ðŸ˜‚

Genes should also be:
- Well defined
- Have a definition that is defined enough to hold up over time
