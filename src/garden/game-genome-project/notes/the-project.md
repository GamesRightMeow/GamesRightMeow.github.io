The _Game Genome Project_ (a riff off of [Pandora's "Music Genome Project"](https://www.pandora.com/about/mgp)) was born out of my frustration with trying to find games I like. Genres do a decent job of providing a broad idea of what a game is, but there's so much variation within even the same genre that it's often not helpful when I'm looking for something _specific_. They're also subject to temporal drift as new games redefine genres (e.g. the rogue-like genre used define a [very specific type of game](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Berlin_Interpretation), but now is often used for anything that has permadeath or procedural generation) and as player expectations evolve.

My goal with this project is to identify what I'm calling video game "genes". Realistically, this isn't going to solve my problem as no one is likely ever to adapt this method of cataloging games, but I thought it might be a fun thought experiment for analyzing game designs.

## What is a video game "gene"?

In humans, genes define hair color, height, tendency to start too many projects, etc. We can apply this to games too by looking at a specific game mechanic (e.g. turn-based movement) or broad system (e.g. item crafting).

## Defining genes

When defining new genes, my main goals are to provide:

1. A precise definition of the gene; how it works, how it feels, etc. The definition may be refined over time, but never evolve into something different.
1. At least two examples in two separate games that illustrate the gene, ideally with screenshots, gameplay clips, and maybe even diagrams!
1. An (ever) growing list of games that exhibit the gene, to provide a way to explore similar games. Maybe one day it will turn into a search engine?
