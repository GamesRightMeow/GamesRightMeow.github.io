The _Game Genome Project_ is a project of mine with the mission of identifying and cataloging "genes" in video games. I've separated this project into its own [plot](../organizing-digital-gardens) to keep it more focused on it's [specific purpose](./notes/the-project).

## Catalogs
- [All Games](./games/)
- [All Genes](./genes/)
- [All Notes](./notes/)
