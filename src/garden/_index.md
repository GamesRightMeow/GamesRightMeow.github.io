This is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), not a blog. There is no linear history. Articles aren't refined or complete. Content is always evolving. This garden is imperfect by design.

I enjoy writing and sharing knowledge, but I've always had a hard time finding regular time to do it. The digital garden philosophy allows me to share knowledge in an iterative way and without committing a bunch of time up front. I'll primarily focus on game development related topics, but I'll probably stray a bit from that path from time to time.

Every article in this garden has three pieces of metadata (idea borrowed from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/about)):
- The __Planted__ date is the date the article was first added to the garden. 
- The __Last tended__ date is when the article was last updated.
- The __Status__ is a rough indicator of how "done" I feel an article is. It can be:
  - ðŸŒ± Seedling - very rough and early ideas
  - ðŸŒ¿ Budding - articles I've cleaned up and clarified
  - ðŸŒ³ Evergreen - articles that are reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).
