# Overview
I've borrowed more terms from IRL gardening to describe digital gardening concepts.

The garden is composed of __Plants__ (aka articles) that are in varying stages of growth. Every plant has has a __Sign__ (aka metadata) that describes its time here in the garden.

The __Planted__ date is the date the article was first added. 

The __Last tended__ date is when the article was last updated. I typically only update this date when I make a change to the content, but not when fixing broken links, correcting typos, etc.

By default both the __Planted__ and __Last tended__ dates show the amount of time that has passed since the respective date (e.g. "Planted 2 years ago"). You can click either of these to toggle the display to an absolute date/time (e.g. "Planted 05/11/2023 5:00 am").

Borrowing from [Maggie Appleton's garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#3-imperfection--learning-in-public), the __Status__ is a rough indicator of how "done" I feel an article is:
  - ðŸŒ± __Seedling__: A very rough and early idea. Often just some notes.
  - ðŸŒ¿ __Budding__: Cleaned up and presentable, but still missing some content.
  - ðŸŒ³ __Evergreen__: Reasonably complete, but I will still tend these over time.

# Navigation
Navigation through the garden is not like a blog, and is best explained by [a quote by Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#1-topography-over-timelines):

> "Gardens are organised around contextual relationships and associative links; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others.
> This runs counter to the time-based structure of traditional blogs: posts presented in reverse chronological order based on publication date."

This means there is no one entrance into the garden, and there are not a finite list of paths that you can take. However sometimes I may build a trail to guide visitors through related content, or make it easier to find articles in a more isolated region of the garden. Sort of like [Andy Matuschak's index pages](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2qjVZKqSqrqkhFhvUpPDtd).

A __Trail__ is an article that contains a hand-curated list of other articles. However unlike real trails, I encourage you to step off of them and explore on your own.

# URLs

I've opted to use [GUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) for file names/urls of articles. While generally I think its best practice for websites to leverage user-friendly URLs, it doesn't quite support the constantly evolving content of a digital garden. 

The main problem I want to avoid is initially naming an article something lame (because naming things is hard) and then coming up with a better name later. With the GUID approach, the filename/URL stays the same and I'm free to update the title whenever I want.

You may find a handful of early articles (like this one) that have a normal looking URL. I planted these prior to the GUID decision, and it seemed easier to leave them be than setup redirects.
