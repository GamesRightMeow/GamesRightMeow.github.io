_⚠️ Disclaimer: what follows is a video game genre that currently doesn't exist, but I'd very much like it to._

I spend a lot of time thinking about and studying game design, both because I like making games, but also to better understand the games I like to play. I tend to gravitate to games tagged as survival, RPG, and sandbox. While I enjoy I enjoy these genres greatly, there's often elements that I wish they did differently. 

# What is a Role Playing Sandbox?
At a high level, the Role Playing Sandbox (RPS) genre describe a game that offer players a richly detailed fictional sandbox that empowers them to play out their own narratives. Specifically:

- No overarching preset narrative for the player.
- Detailed world building either with hand-crafted, procedural generation, or a mix of both.
- Allows the player to roleplay as any occupation/profession. Not limited to preset archetypes and allows mix matching them.
- Crafting, building, or other mechanics that allow the player to "live" in the world.
- A world that reacts to the player being in it.
- A focus on exploration, and making traveling through the world engaging.
- Player directly controls a single character in either first or third person.

# Why not existing genres
- __Sandbox__: Often provide a plethora of mechanics and content to play with, but shallow world building
  - [Teardown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167630/Teardown/) has tons of fun mechanics for destroying structures, but has a shallow and preset narrative for the player.
  - [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) provides a lego-like building sandbox, but has little world building.
  - [Kenshi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/) supports roleplaying any role, but takes a real-time strategy approach to character control.
- __RPG__: Provide deeply detailed worlds, but force the player into a specific narrative 
  - You're always a witcher in the [The Witcher 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/).
  - You're always the [dragonborn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragonborn) in [Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/).
- __Survival__: Often provide procedural generation, a loose overarching plot, and fun building and crafting mechanics, but very focused on the survival aspects.
  - [Valheim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/) has a procedurally generated game world soaked in Norse mythology, but you're always a viking trying to reach Valhalla.
  - [Don't Starve](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219740/Dont_Starve/) deep crafting and rewarding exploration, but you're always just someone trying not to starve.

# Partial examples 
While this genre doesn't officially exist, there's some existing games that I think partially fall into the definition, and heavily inspired this idea.

## Caves of Qud
- ✅Mix of procedural generation and hand crafted content.
- ✅Huge open world.
- ✅No overarching narrative for the player.
- ✅Faction system makes it feel like the world is reacting to player choices.
- ⛔Doesn't have crafting or building mechanics.
- ⛔Focused on combat and character progression. It's not satisfying to roleplay as a [watervine farmer](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Watervine_farmer) who just...farms watervines.

## Minecraft
- ✅Procedurally generated terrain.
- ✅Complete player agency.
- ✅Freeform building.
- ⛔World is largely unreactive to the player.
- ⛔Shallow world building.
- ⛔You can truly roleplay "anything" but the world doesn't acknowledge or support it.

## Skyrim
- ✅Mechanics that support roleplaying as anything.
- ✅Deep world building and lore.
- ✅Rewarding exploration and travel.
- ⛔Has a main story and preset identity for the player. While you generally can ignore it, it can be distracting to be acknowledged as the dragonborn when you're trying to play a simple hunter.
