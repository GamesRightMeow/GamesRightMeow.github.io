A Roleplaying Sandbox (RPS) is a video game genre that describes a game that doesn't force an overarching narrative on the player, but offers a world with many interlinking systems that allow them to play out their own stories.

Examples:
- RimWorld
- Minecraft
- Skyrim (has a main story, but can largely be ignored)
