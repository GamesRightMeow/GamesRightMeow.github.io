I've picked up an odd assortment of knowledge for squeezing the most performance out of games. I very rarely work on the newest, most capable hardware so I've spent a lot of time finding ways to accomplish the ambitious goals of designers and artists.

While there are common patterns, every game is different. It's important to [understand the unique performance problems](/garden/unity-analyzing-performance) in your game first before making decisions on where to focus your attention.

## Avoid UnityEngine.Object comparisons when possible
[UnityEngine.Object comparisons are expensive](https://blog.unity.com/technology/custom-operator-should-we-keep-it)! This applies to null checks and dictionaries since they both compare the objects internally. A one off comparison here and there is okay, but doing it hundreds of times per frame is going to hit FPS, especially on lower end hardware (like the Nintendo Switch).

## Cache expensive methods
- Camera.main
- GameObject.transform
- Renderer.Material
- Transform.Find
- FindObjectOfType/FindObjectsOfType/FindObjectOfTypeAll 

## Leverage data locality
Use arrays. [Data locality](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html).
Arrays are faster than Lists 

## Use fewer shaders
Simply accessing Renderer.material will assign a new instance of the material. If assigning shader properties, use [MaterialPropertyBlocks](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MaterialPropertyBlock.html) instead.

Each shader is another set of draw calls. And if you don't have GPU instancing enabled, each instance is also drawn separated instead of being combined into a batch.

## Use integer ids
Thereâ€™s a few instances where Unity allows integer and string ids in their API. The string APIs are often used by they are much less performant than their int counterparts, such as: 
Global shader properties or material properties [Shader.PropertyToId](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Shader.PropertyToID.html)
Animator parameters [Animator.StringToHash](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Animator.StringToHash.html)
