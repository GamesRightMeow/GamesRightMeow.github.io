<!-- __Plots__ are folders (e.g. [gamesrightmeow.com/garden/game-genome-project](https://gamesrightmeow.com/garden/game-genome-project)) that contain pages that are related in some way as opposed to putting them in the main garden plot (e.g. [gamesrightmeow.com/garden](https://gamesrightmeow.com/garden/)). -->

__Catalogs__ are pages that contain curated (either by hand or automation) lists of other pages, that are grouped because of a shared theme. For example, the ["All pages" page](/garden/all-pages).
