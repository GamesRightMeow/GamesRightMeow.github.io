<!-- TODO: longer intro -->
My diverse background in games means I can help out with a wide range of different projects. Some examples include:

* Implement a new feature.
* Optimize for desktop, consoles, web, or mobile.
* Lead development on a new project.
* Port your game to another platform.
* Automate your build pipeline.
* Cleanup tech debt.
* Recommend restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area.
* ...and more!

# testimonials
> …Hire Alex. He's hard working and talented. He is responsible, helpful, and always exceeded my expectations. I feel confident in throwing technology at him he has no experience with, and knowing his bar for quality will not drop, but increase. He tackles the scary stuff…I would definitely hire him again, 100%.
