I have over 10 years of experience building games. I specialize in Unity 3D,

Projects I've helped previous clients with.

* Optimizations for desktop, consoles, web, and mobile
* Lead development
* Cleanup bugs in 

# what my clients are saying
> Wow!  

\- someone, somewhere

> Cool!  

\- someone else, over there

# let's talk
If you want to learn more, you can try emailing me, but I'll probably just reply with a GIF. But feel free to send comments and questions to:

_contact [no bots plz] gamesrightmeow [mew] com_

Note: I've used some super high-tech wizardry to obfuscate my email. If you can't figure it out, then you're probably a spambot and shouldn't be emailing me anyways.
