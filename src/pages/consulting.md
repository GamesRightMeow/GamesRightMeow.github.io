I provide a variety of game-related services that help bring new projects to life, improve existing ones, and make the development process more efficient. For example:

* Implement a new feature.
* Lead development on a new project.
* Port your game to another platform.
* Automate your build pipeline.
* Identify and implement optimizations.
* Build tools to automate tedious manual tasks.
* Refactor legacy code.
* Cleanup a tech debt backlog.
* ...and more!

# testimonials
> Alex helped out with our mobile game Race The Sun:Challenge Edition, and was basically productive on the project on day one. He took every task I threw at him and figured it out independently; he's consistently delivered high quality work, on schedule; and he's an awesome communicator. Highly recommend hiring him!

> …Hire Alex. He's hard working and talented. He is responsible, helpful, and always exceeded my expectations. I feel confident in throwing technology at him he has no experience with, and knowing his bar for quality will not drop, but increase. He tackles the scary stuff…I would definitely hire him again, 100%.

> …He is a wizard at taking ideas and making them happen. As a team member, Alex is super collaborative, thoughtful, fun, and brings interesting solutions to barriers along the development process. I'd have him on every project if I could!
