# Overview
We strongly support your right to privacy when using our products.

To the extent that our products and websites can provide their functionality without doing so, we prefer to avoid collecting data from you.

In the cases where we do collect data, we try to be clear about why we're collecting it, collect as little as we need, tell you how long we keep it, delete it when we no longer need it, and give you the ability to opt out of collection whenever possible.

We use modern security measures to protect collected data, and limit access to only those employees who require access to perform their jobs. We may be legally required to disclose collected data to law enforcement or government agencies in some situations.

# Support Interactions
When handling support requests from you, we collect:

- Depending on how you contact us, either your email address, Bluesky handle, or Discord handle.
- Any other metadata which may be contained in the email header.
- Any information you provide voluntarily (such as crash logs, screenshots, other diagnostics).

This information is collected solely to help resolve your support inquiry. We retain support requests indefinitely in order to:

- Have context from previous interactions which may help us answer your future questions more quickly and accurately.
- Identify broad trends in support requests, which may help us identify and solve problems with our products.

If you would like to remove support requests you have sent, contact privacy[at]gamesrightmeow.com.
