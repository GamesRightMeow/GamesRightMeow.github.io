**Suborbital Salvage** is an endless runner set in a dystopian corporate future where you collect salvage and avoid hazards while getting berated by your supervisor. Who is also a cat.

> On behalf of Suborbital Salvage Ltd., I am pleased to offer you the position of Salvage Pilot! You start immediately, with no benefits. If you survive training, you'll be generously offered an hourly salary.
> 
> You will be required to:
> - Avoid asteroids, space mines, rogue missiles, and 10+ other hazards.
> - Collect salvage. No you can't keep it.
> - Not crash your multi-million dollar spaceship.
> - Refrain from feeding the giant space fish.
> 
> Cheers,  
> Your new supervisor
