# Nodoku

Nodoku offers a brain-bending new way to play with numbers, kill time, and stay sharp. Use your mathematical super powers to discover additive sequences and solve clean, colorful, free-form line puzzles. 

Snappy animations and transitions make this addictive, compulsively playable game ideal for quick plays on the bus or for marathon sessions while you binge Netflix. With 100+ handcrafted, deceptively simple levels, Nodoku is easy to learn, but tricky to master.
