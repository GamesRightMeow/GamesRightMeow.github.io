Nodoku was quietly soft launched back in April. However today it is now officially available! To celebrate the occasion Nodoku has had a small content update:

* Added new mechanic: nodes with negative values
* Added 25 new puzzles
* Added title screen
* Added option to opt out of Unity Analytics for GDPR
* Fixed nodes getting stuck in wrong state when rapidly tapping them
* Simplified bottom popup menu in puzzle view
